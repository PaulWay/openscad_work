Battery accessories

**File: `AEG 58V battery holder v1.scad`**

A slide to hold the AEG 58V power tool batteries.  Both old and new 58V
battery measurements are provided, and the slides can be tilted so the battery
slides down into the frame and has to be pulled out against gravity, making it
slightly more secure.

**File: `thundersky_battery_handle_v1.scad`**

A handle to fit on ThunderSky / Winston Energy 60AH LiFePO4 cells, so that
the pack can be lifted as a whole.  Currently contains the `pinch` function
for operating on lists of 2D points.
