Things I've made that don't really have a good home anywhere else.

**File: `cable_patch_end_clip_v1.scad`**
**File: `cable_patch_end_clip_v2.scad`**

Clips for a 12-port Cat-5 patch bay that don't get in the way of the cables
to be attached.

**File: `cupcake_holder_plate.scad`**
**File: `cupcake_holder.scad`**

Two different systems for pieces that go in a standard food container and
prevent cupcakes or muffins from moving around and destroying themselves when
in transit.

**File: `downpipe_mount.scad`**

A piece that lifts the mount for the downpipe to our eastern water tank up so
that the pipe itself sits higher than the sieve.

**File: `garden_bed_hose_guide.scad`**

A piece that could be printed in two parts that locked together, such that it
could sit on the side of a garden bed wall and guide a hose without kinking.

**File: `organza_bag_funnel.scad`**

A basic funnel, designed for filling the specific organza bags I use to sell
camphor laurel and huon pine shavings.

**File: `red_hat_service_award_holder.scad`**

For those in Red Hat who have received their five and ten year 'puck', this
is a much more stable base for it.  The award won't fall out easily and it
fits it perfectly.  Best printed in red, obviously.

**File: `rob_food_processor_lid.scad`**

A replacement lid for a friend's food processor.

**File: `rounded_square_twist_vase.scad`**

Using the example of the `offset` 2D function and twist in `linear_extrude`
to make some interesting simple vases.  Best with rainbow, bi-colour or
tri-colour filament.

**File: `thundersky_battery_handle_v1.scad`**

A handle to fit on ThunderSky / Winston Energy 60AH LiFePO4 cells, so that
the pack can be lifted as a whole.  Currently contains the `pinch` function
for operating on lists of 2D points.

**File: `tickety_boo_sign.scad`**

For indicating to other people whether everything is tickety-boo or not.

**File: `tile_cutter_anvil.scad`**

A replacement anvil for the tile cutter my partner uses for breaking mosaic
tiles.

**File: `trailer_towball_filler.scad`**

A part that can fit in a trailer towball hitch, and be locked in place, so
that no-one else can tow the trailer.

**File: `trevor table foot v1.0.scad`**

A replacement for a table foot for a friend.

**File: `urban_500_mount.scad`**

A mount for the Urban 500 bicycle light.
