**Paul's OpenSCAD models and libraries.**

Hi!  Welcome to my OpenSCAD library.  Please feel free to use any of these
models - they are all licensed under the Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution
Non-Commercial license.  This means you can use it, but if you modify it you
need to name me, and you cannot sell these designs or things based on them.

Most of these models are parameterised - they are based on constants that can
be adjusted.

It's divided up (thanks to help!) into somewhat arbitrary sections:

- `Basic_tools` - things I've put together to make other things work
- `Battery_accessories` - for handling some of the batteries I've got
- `Cardboard_perforator` - parts for a thing a bit like a shredder
- `Dust_extraction` - things for moving air, and dust, around
- `EV_Charging` - holders for EV chargers
- `Gridfinity_tools` - particularly my magnet dispenser and placer
- `libs` - **most important** - tools to make other models
- `Oddments` - things that didn't yet fit in a more obvious category
- `PaulStore` - a library for generating assemblable storage units
- `PCB_cases` - various cases for putting various PCBs in
- `Test_pieces` - initial tests that sometimes become library modules
- `Woodworking and workshop tools` - that I've made for my workshop
