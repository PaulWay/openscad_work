Test pieces
-----------

Mainly used when I'm trying out ideas before I put them in my libraries.

**File: `conduit_angle_bend.scad`**
**File: `conduit_angle_bend_toroidal.scad`**

Work on angled bends that can attach to standard PVC piping.

**File: `cylinder_from_to.scad`**

Testing being able to create a cylinder from and to two arbitrary XYZ
locations.  This is useful for forming cylindrical lattices and other
shapes formed of linked cylinders that are not easily defined in terms
of their rotations or translations in relation to each-other.

**File: `shredder_blade.scad`**

Tests for constructing a shredder blade in plastic.

**File: `spring_tests.scad`**

Testing out both straight and circular 'springs' that use a zig-zag
construction.  Best printed so that each layer goes along the zig-zag, rather
than the zig-zag going up and down across layers.

**File: `tap_handle.scad`**

Experimenting with modules that can make tap handles with a shaft and a
number of 'lobes'.

**File: `y_tube.scad`**

A Y join in a pipe, made out of toroid segments.
