Test pieces
-----------

Mainly used when I'm trying out ideas before I put them in my libraries.

**File: `conduit_angle_bend.scad`**
**File: `conduit_angle_bend_toroidal.scad`**

Work on angled bends that can attach to standard PVC piping.

**File: `spring_tests.scad`**

Testing out both straight and circular 'springs' that use a zig-zag
construction.  Best printed so that each layer goes along the zig-zag, rather
than the zig-zag going up and down across layers.

**File: `tap_handle.scad`**

Experimenting with modules that can make tap handles with a shaft and a
number of 'lobes'.

**File: `y_tube.scad`**

A Y join in a pipe, made out of toroid segments.
