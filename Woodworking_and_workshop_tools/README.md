Woodworking and workshop tools
------------------------------

**File: `masonry_drill_rack_v1.0.scad`**

A basic block to store the masonry drills I have.

**File: `oscillating_sander_vacuum_adapter.scad`**

An adapter that fits on the side of the AEG oscillating power sander and
directly connects to a vacuum hose for a workshop vacuum cleaner.

**File: `trend_airshield_battery_pack.scad`**

Still early experiments on making a replacement for the Trend AirShield Pro
battery.  The idea is to build in a LiPo pouch cell, a USB charger board, and
possibly a regulated 3.6V output board.

**File: `vicmarc_chuck_gauge_v1.scad`**

Simple pieces that show the inside and outside dimensions of Vicmarc lathe
chuck jaws, at their minimum and maximum extend (i.e. narrowest and widest).
Includes writing the dimensions and the chuck 'number'.
